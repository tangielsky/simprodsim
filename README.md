Simple Production Simulation
============================
My goals for this project is to find out if it's possible to code a simple simulation of production processes.
And help with this to answers questions to optimize productions.

You'll find some more details on the projects webseite:

The project is coded with Lazarus (2.0.8) and uses a Mircosoft Access database (MDB file) as a data storage.
